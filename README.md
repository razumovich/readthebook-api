# readthebook-api

This project is designed to keep together all the services related to Read The Book App.

## Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is required to run / deploy services from this core repository. However, **each service can be run / deployed directly from its folder** and in this case there's no need to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), npm works well too.

## Installation/deployment instructions
- Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
- Run `yarn deploy:products` to deploy Products Service to AWS
- Run `yarn deploy:all` to deploy all the services to AWS

## Run locally

In order to run all the services locally, run the following command:
- `yarn start`
